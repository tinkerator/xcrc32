# xcrc32

## Overview

This package provides a CRC32 algorithm. It appears to be used in a
number of embedded applications, expecially those built using tools
like gcc and debugged with gdb. It is not obviously related to the
standard
[golang.org/pkg/hash/crc32](https://golang.org/pkg/hash/crc32/)
support, so we've provided a version here.

Automated documentation for this Go package is available from
[![Go Reference](https://pkg.go.dev/badge/zappem.net/pub/debug/xcrc32.svg)](https://pkg.go.dev/zappem.net/pub/debug/xcrc32).

## License info

The xcrc32 package is distributed with the same BSD 3-clause license
as that used by [golang](https://golang.org/LICENSE) itself.
